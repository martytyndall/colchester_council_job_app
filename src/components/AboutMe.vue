    <div class="about-me">
        <p>A logically thinking, meticulous individual with 
            a passion for technology.
            Having run my own small business over the past four 
            years, I have developed strong organisational skills 
            with regards to planning and meeting deadlines.
            One of the key requirements in this role is to 
            liaise with customers, discuss their requirements, 
            and build a rapport with regular customers, 
            something which I enjoy very much.
            
            In my spare time I am working towards an 
            undergraduate Honours degree in computer science, 
            which I enjoy very much, as it allows me to apply 
            my knowledge in some of my favourite subject areas 
            such as software/web development and IT networks.
